Welcome! In this club, we are creative. We have ideas, like 
books to make, websites, to make, and games, too.
See our process below:

Idea-producer/_________:
Idea-producers produce the ideas that other branches make. For 
example, they produce the idea of books, say. They show other 
branches that are assigned it, the book-creator, the idea. They 
prompt the book-creators constantly, what to write.

________-creators:
Creators are prompted by the Idea-producers, on what to make/write. 
Once finished, they will talk to their Idea-producer, and tell them 
what they made. If given the signal that they can, they deploy it to their succesor, their viewer.

_______-viewers:
Viewers are sent the ideas made by the creators(and prompted by the producers) for a last view, and 
then sent to the master. Then, all three of those in that category talk about what they did. If 
everyone agrees that the file is good, then it is sent to the master.

master:
The master views the files before puplishing them. He assignes people's jobs when they join, and
gets to know about all files being made.
